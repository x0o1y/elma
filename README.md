## Native macOS port

This fork adds a native Apple Silicon macOS backend using SDL2. It builds the
original game and physics code as a Mach-O arm64 executable; Wine and DOSBox
are not involved. The default build selects the original shareware profile to
match the freely distributable game data.

### Dependencies

Install CMake and SDL2 compatibility libraries with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install cmake pkg-config sdl2-compat
```

### Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
cmake --build build -j8
```

### Game data

The upstream source release deliberately excludes the copyrighted game data.
Copy these files from a legally obtained Elasto Mania installation:

```text
elma.res
lgr/default.lgr
```

Create empty runtime directories if they do not exist:

```sh
mkdir -p lev rec snaps
```

Run the executable from the repository root so it can find the data:

```sh
./build/elma
```

The current macOS backend provides native video, keyboard, mouse and timing.
Audio is temporarily disabled.

### Keyamp controls

The macOS backend adds a right-hand Keyamp movement cluster without removing
the original arrow controls:

```text
I  throttle
K  brake
E  brake alias
J  rotate left
L  rotate right
;  alovolt
Space  turn
P  screenshot
```

The mapping uses physical SDL scancodes, so it is independent of the active
keyboard input language. Text entry continues to receive the typed letters.
Menus use the same `I/K/J/L` navigation cluster, `F` confirms, `Q` escapes and
`D` deletes. Shift inserts those letters literally, following Keyamp
command-mode behavior.
